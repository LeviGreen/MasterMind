#MasterMind Project

##The purpose of this repo is to track the progression of building an automated version of the game MasterMind, using Python, my Raspberry Pi, and a 3D-Printer

##NOTE: If you look at the Network Tree, you will see that it is sort of a mess.
##	Explanation: At some point I accidentally changed the name of the master branch to 'main.'
##	I didn't like this so I tried to change it back but couldn't...so I just created a new
##	branch named master and deleted 'main.'
##	That being said, this is my current work flow: 
##	Work in the dev branch while I'm writing code. Once it works the way I want it to,
##	merge the dev branch back into the master.
